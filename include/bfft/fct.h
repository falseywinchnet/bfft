/* Public C ABI for the FCT kernel: the Fast Correlated Transform.
   This header lives alongside <bfft/bfft.h> and reuses its complex and
   status types.

   The FCT is FORWARD-ONLY, by construction.  For each standard bin k of a
   real frame of length N it emits the leading-edge correlation

       C[k] = sum_{t=0}^{tau_k - 1} x[t] * exp(-2*pi*i*k*t/N)

   at the globally maximizing slice tau_k in [t_min, N] selected under the
   score |C|^2 / tau (the emitted phase is the arctan(A/B) of the underlying
   sine/cosine correlation pair at that slice).  Bins with no coherent
   leading edge below an optional certified activity floor default to tau = N,
   i.e. the plain FFT bin. The intrinsic phase-disk walk certifies the global
   argmax for every emitted active bin; with the default zero floor every bin
   is exact. The selection is nonlinear and the fixed truncation family it
   optimizes over is exponentially ill-conditioned, so no inverse exists;
   attempts to invert must reconstruct from the plain FFT bins instead.

   Output layout matches bfft_forward: N/2 + 1 packed complex values in
   standard order. */
